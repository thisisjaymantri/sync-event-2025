## üöÄ Step 3: Configure Vercel

### 3.1 Get Your Sheet ID

From your Google Sheet URL, copy the ID:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[THIS_IS_YOUR_SHEET_ID]/edit
```

### 3.2 Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jaylightsparkcs-projects/sync/settings/environment-variables
2. Add two new variables:

**Variable 1:**
- **Key**: `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
- **Value**: Your sheet ID from step 3.1
- **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development

**Variable 2:**
- **Key**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your API key from step 2.2
- **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development

3. Click **Save** for each
4. **Redeploy** your site (Vercel will prompt you)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test It!

1. Visit your live site
2. In dev mode, you'll see a small badge showing `google-sheets` if connected
3. Edit your Google Sheet (change a status or event name)
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Refresh your site ‚Üí Changes should appear!

---

## üì± Day-of-Event Usage

### For Your Event Staff:

**Updating the schedule:**
1. Open the Google Sheet on phone/tablet
2. Find the current event
3. Change its **Status** column to `Active`
4. Change previous event to `Complete`
5. Save (happens automatically in Google Sheets)
6. Changes appear on the live site within 30 seconds!

**Pro Tips:**
- Use data validation in Google Sheets to create a dropdown for the Status column
- Keep the sheet open on a tablet backstage
- Assign one person as "schedule manager"
- Test the workflow before the event

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Schedule isn't updating?
- Check that BOTH environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify the sheet is shared as "Anyone with link can view"
- Check that Status values are exactly: `Upcoming`, `Active`, or `Complete` (case-sensitive)
- Look at browser console for error messages

### Shows "local" or "local-fallback"?
- Sheet is not connected yet (using hardcoded data)
- This is fine! The site still works, just not editable from sheets

### API quota errors?
- Google Sheets API has generous free limits
- Your app only fetches once per 30 seconds per viewer
- For a typical event, you'll be well within limits

---

## üé® Optional: Add Data Validation

Make it easier for staff to set the status correctly:

1. Select the Status column (C2:C100)
2. **Data** ‚Üí **Data validation**
3. Criteria: **List of items**
4. Enter: `Upcoming,Active,Complete`
5. Click **Save**

Now the Status column has a dropdown! ‚ú®

## üîÑ Reverting to Hardcoded Data

To disable Google Sheets and use the hardcoded schedule:

1. Go to Vercel environment variables
2. Delete `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
3. Redeploy

The app will automatically use `lib/schedule-data.ts` as the source.

Need help? The app gracefully falls back to hardcoded data if anything goes wrong, so your event will never break! üéâ
